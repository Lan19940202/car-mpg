Summary
=======

A small Python program to test the ability to predict car fuel economy
(in mpg) given various specifications: {cylinders, displacement, horsepower,
weight, acceleration, year, origin}.  Currently, standard deviation of
prediction (regression) error is around 2.9 mpg.

This is perhaps not useful for modern predictions -- the dataset is for cars
built in 1970-1982.  Extrapolating too far into the future (as in now) will
probably not be too successful.  Really, this is just educational.
